           <h1>The Style of Catullus</h1>
           <p>
               Catullus often wrote in <strong>elegiac couplets</strong>, common in <strong>love poems</strong>. A great part of his poetry shows strong and occasionally erratic emotions, especially in regard to <strong>Lesbia</strong>, the personification of his lover within his poems. He portrays this dynamic as a requited lover to someone whom had many suitors, but still manages to demonstrate great sense of humor.
