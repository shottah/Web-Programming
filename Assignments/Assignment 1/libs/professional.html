                    Catullus' collection of <strong>116 Carmina</strong> is hailed as his magnum opus. The volume is split into three parts: poems, short poems of varying meters, and epigrams.

                    I adored you - not in the way a girl would be, <br>By a whole crowd of suitors, rather more <br>As a father loves his sons and sons-in-law. <br>I really know you now; therefore, despite <br>My fiercer burning, you're still, in my sight, <br>A cheaper and more trivial thing by far. <br>How canthis be? You ask. Because a scar <br>Like this compels your lover under stress, <br>To love you more, but respect you less.
