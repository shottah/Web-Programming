              <h2>Catullus of Rome</h2>
               <p><strong>Gaius Valerius Catullus</strong> was a <strong>latin poet</strong> of the late Roman Republic, writing in the neoteric style of poetry. That is, he fancied writing about personal endeavours rather than classical and political heroes. He was more relateable to others in this sense. His surviving works are still heavily influencial on poetry and other art forms.</p>
               <p>
                    After his rediscovery in the  Late <strong> Middle Ages</strong>, he was again admired for his explicit style. Although, never popular in schools, he is still appreciated in graduate programs around the world.

                  Understanding the Life of a Poet
              </h2>
               <p class="nav-data">As one of my personally favorite poets of the neo-romantic genre, Catullus' life is inspirational in the values instilled in him through family life as well as personal ventures. </p>

                    His life's work has been preserved in a collection of poems (that slightly vary - thematically) dedicated to his lover. The name of the work is addressed as <strong>116 Carmina</strong>.

                    During Catullus' time experimenting with various poetic styles of the time, there was a paradigm shit away from the standard <strong>epic poetry</strong>. This shift was largely enabled by <strong>neotori</strong> or modern innovators of the style.
